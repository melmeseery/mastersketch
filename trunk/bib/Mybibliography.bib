  abstract = {Current computer-based design tools for mechanical engineers are not
	tailored to early stages of design. Most designers use pencil and
	paper at first, and only input their design into CAD systems after
	it is nearly complete. The tradeoff between the ease of drawing and
	the precision of a CAD tool is too great in for engineers who are
	just sketching out rough designs. My thesis will present a tool which
	is specifically geared towards designers in the earlier stages of
	design. Our system interprets and represents mechanical sketches
	as the user sketches them, then allows the user to simulate her system
	using a two-dimensional kinematic simulator. In particular, my thesis
	will introduce a method to translate a sketch into the designer's
	intended mechanical devices, despite ambiguities in the sketch.},

  abstract = {Social insects--ants, bees, termites, and wasps--can be viewed as
	powerful problem-solving systems with sophisticated collective intelligence.
	Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in
	the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals
	and the environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also
	a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems
	they solve--finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building
	nests, responding to external challenges--have important counterparts
	in engineering and computer science. This book provides a detailed
	look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models
	in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models
	replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization
	with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning.
	These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to
	adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning
	even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs
	are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in
	software and information. Swarm Intelligence draws on up-to-date
	research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics,
	operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized
	around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop
	an algorithm, a multiagent system, or a group of robots. The book
	will be an invaluable resource for a broad range of disciplines.},

	During the actual robot use, he should focus on the task to be done
	rather than worrying about the robot or the interaction modality.
	To address this goal, we have been investigating the use of hand-drawn
	route maps to transfer navigation tasks to robots. In the paper,
	we provide an overview and current status of ongoing work with sketches.
	We discuss what type of information would be useful for directing
	and controlling a robot and then show how this information can be
	extracted from a sketched route map, in the form of spatial relationships.
	An analysis example of a PDA-generated sketch is included. Also,
	preliminary results are presented which compare the analysis of a
	sketched map with that of a real map.},

	From these experiments, we have derived a computational model for
	predicting perceived gesture similarity that correlates 0.56 with
	observation. We will incorporate the results of these experiments
	into a gesture design tool, which will aid the pen-based UI designer

  abstract = {The Sketchpad system makes it possible for a man and a computer to
	converse rapidly through the medium of line drawings. Heretofore,
	most interaction between man and computers has been slowed down by
	the need to reduce all communication to written statements that can
	be typed; in the past, we have been writing letters to rather than
	conferring with our computers. For many types of communication, such
	as describing the shape of a mechanical part or the connections of
	an electrical circuit, typed statements can prove cumbersome. The
	Sketchpad system, by eliminating typed statements (except for legends)
	in favor of line drawings, opens up a new area of man-machine communication.},
