abstract = {Automatic handwriting recognition has a variety of applications in
real world problems, such as mail sorting and check processing. Recently,
it has been demonstrated that combining the decisions of several
classifiers and integrating multiple information sources can lead
to better recognition results. This article presents an approach
for recognizing handwritten Arabic literal (legal) amounts. The proposed
system uses a set of holistic structural features to describe the
words. These features are presented to three classifiers: multilayer
neural network, k nearest neighbor, and fuzzy k nearest neighbor.
The classification results are then combined using several schemes;
we retained the score summation one for this work. A syntactic post-classification
process is then carried out to find the best match among the candidate
words. The performance of this approach is superior to the system
which ignores all contextual information and simply relies on the
recognition scores of the recognizers.},

abstract = {Baseline extraction is hailed as an important step in handwriting
primitive extraction process, seen the insights it proffers into
the position and the length of the word. It further facilitates feature
extraction. As regards Arabic words, tow baselines can be extracted:
an upper baseline and a lower one. These tow lines divide the word
into three parts, namely, Ascender and upper diacritic points above
the upper baseline, Descender and lower diacritic points under the
lower baseline. The main content of the word lies between the two
baselines, it generally involves loops. In this paper we start with
a presentation of six baseline extraction methods. These methods
are developed and evaluated with reference to IFN/ENIT-database .
Some of them are combined in order to improve baseline position.
A comparison between these methods is made on the basis of the IFN/ENIT-database.
Results on the set a of IFN/ENIT-database evince that the Skeletonbased
method and the Min-Max \& Primitives achieve very promising results
reaching about 77\% of good results and about 87\% of acceptable results},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method for efficient nearest neighbor classification
in non-Euclidean spaces with computationally expensive similarity/distance
measures. Efficient approximations of such measures are obtained
using the BoostMap algorithm, which produces embeddings into a real
vector space. A modification to the BoostMap algorithm is proposed,
which uses an optimization cost that is more appropriate when our
goal is classification accuracy as opposed to nearest neighbor retrieval
accuracy. Using the modified algorithm, multiple approximate nearest
neighbor classifiers are obtained, that provide a wide range of trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency. The approximations are automatically
combined to form a cascade classifier, which applies the slower and
more accurate approximations only to the hardest cases. The proposed
method is experimentally evaluated in the domain of handwritten digit
recognition using shape context matching. Results on theMNIST database
indicate that a speed-up of two to three orders of magnitude is gained
over brute force search, with minimal losses in classification accuracy.},

The Modified Direction Feature (MDF) extraction technique builds upon the Direction Feature (DF) technique proposed previously that extracts direction information from the structure of character contours. This principal was extended so that the direction information is integrated with a technique for detecting transitions between background and foreground pixels in the character image. In order to improve on the DF extraction technique, a number of modifications were undertaken. With a view to describe the character contour more effectively, a re-design of the direction number determination technique was performed. Also, an additional global feature was introduced to improve the recognition accuracy for those characters that were most frequently confused with patterns of similar appearance. MDF was tested using a neural network-based classifier and compared to the DF and Transition Feature (TF) extraction techniques. MDF outperformed both DF and TF techniques using a benchmark dataset and compared favourably with the top results in the literature. A recognition accuracy of above 89\% is reported on characters from the CEDAR dataset.},

abstract = {This paper presents a minimal Arabic text that covers

the different basic shapes of Arabic alphabet (viz. standalone, initial,

medial, and terminal). It is designed with minimal repetition of

character shapes in the minimal text. The novelty of the suggested

script could be seen from different perspectives. It enables the

collection of handwritten text from different writers with minimized

effort and time. It is enough for a writer to write three lines of

meaningful Arabic text to cover all possible character shapes, a total

of 125 shapes. The written text is designed to have even distribution

of letter frequencies. This assures enough samples of all character

shapes when text is collected from enough number of writers. The

same is true for printed Arabic text. This is especially useful when

using large number of features with classifiers that require large

number of samples for each category. Hidden Markov Models and

Neural networks are two examples of these classifiers. The use of
the

minimal text enables proper training, as all Arabic character shapes

are present with adequate frequency, hence resulting in higher

recognition rates. This is not the case with natural text where the

frequency of some Arabic characters differ widely, where in some

cases 100 folds or more. The proposed minimal text may be used to

build a data base of handwritten Arabic text collected of many

writers. This covers the need for a database in the research of Arabic

handwritten text recognition and benchmarking.

In addition, this paper presents statistical analysis of Arabic

corpora for estimating the number of occurrences of the different

shapes of Arabic characters in large corpora. The frequency of Arabic

characters could be used in different applications. In this research

work, it was utilized in enhancing the search for the minimal Arabic

text.},

abstract = {Off-line recognition requires transferring the text under consideration into an image file. This represents the only available solution to bring the printed materials to the electronic media. However, the transferring process causes the system to lose the temporal information of that text. Other complexities that an off-line recognition system has to deal with are the lower resolution of the document and the poor binarisation, which can contribute to readability when essential features of the characters are deleted or obscured. Recognising Arabic script presents two additional challenges: orthography is cursive and letter shape is context sensitive. Certain character combinations form new ligature shapes, which are often font-dependent. Some ligatures involve vertical stacking of characters. Since not all letters connect, word boundary location becomes an interesting problem, as spacing may separate not only words, but also certain characters within a word. Various techniques have been implemented to achieve high recognition rates. These techniques have tackled different aspects of the recognition system. This review is organised into five major sections, covering a general overview, Arabic writing characteristics, Arabic text recognition system, Arabic OCR software and conclusions.},

is adopted in this system. In order to achieve high performances
in terms of efficiency and reliability, a knowledge-based module
is proposed for the date segmentation and a cursive month word recognition
module is implemented based on a combination of classifiers. The
interaction between the segmentation and recognition stages is properly
established by using multihypotheses generation and evaluation modules.
As a result, promising performance is obtained on a test set from
a real life standard cheque database},

abstract = {The purpose of our research is to improve the recogni- tion rate of off-line character recognition systems using the HMM (Hidden Markov Model) without increasing a num- ber of HMM parameters too much. Some 2-dimensional HMM character recognition systems have been proposed to increase representational power. However, since 2â€“D HMM has much more complex structure and thus requires much more parameters than 1-dimensional HMM, it be- comes very hard to gather sufficient samples in order to guarantee the successful generalization. To overcome the problem, we propose amethod for character recognition us- ing 1â€“D HMMs in multiple directions with 2-dimensional feature extraction. To further improve the performance, some voting method useing bagging algorithmare also ex- ploited. In our experiment, the recognition rate is increased by about 1\% with the multiple directional HMM charac- ter recognition system compared to the 1â€“D HMMcharac- ter recognition system. The recognition rate is further in- creased by about 1\% with the HMM character recognition system using bagging algorithm.},

Second, Curvature Scale Space-based (CSS-based) substroke segmentation is used to calculate the optimal state number and initial state parameters. Third, Self-rotation restricted corner state and imaginary stroke state are designed to determine state connectivity and Gaussian mixture number in order to achieve better state alignment.

@article{Mahmoud2008,
abstract = {This paper describes a technique for the recognition of optical off-line handwritten Arabic (Indian) numerals using hidden Markov models (HMM). The success of HMM in speech recognition encouraged researchers to apply it to text recognition. In this work we did not follow the general trend of using sliding windows in the direction of the writing line to generate features. Instead we generated features based on the digit as a unit. Angle-, distance-, horizontal-, and vertical-span features are extracted from Arabic (Indian) numerals and used in training and testing the HMM. These features proved to be simple and effective. In addition to the HMM the nearest neighbor classifier is used. The results of both classifiers are then compared. Several experiments were conducted for estimating the suitable number of states for the HMM. The best results were achieved with an HMM model with 10 states. In addition, we experimented with different number of features. The best results were achieved with 120 feature vector representing a digit. A database of 44 writers, each writer wrote 48 samples of each digit resulting in a database of 21,120 samples. The data were size normalized to enable the technique to be size invariant. In extracting the features the center of gravity of the digit is used to make the technique translation invariant. The randomization technique was used to generate Arabic (Indian) numbers for training and testing the HMM classifier. The randomization was done on the number of digits per number and on the digit sequence. About 2171 Arabic (Indian) numbers were generated, totaling 21,120 digits. 1700 numbers (totaling 16,657 digits) were used in training the HMM and 471 numbers (totaling 4463 digits) are used in testing the HMM. The samples of the first 24 writers were used in training the nearest neighbor classifier and the remaining 20 writers' samples were used in testing. The achieved average recognition rates are 97.99\% and 94.35\% using the HMM and the nearest neighbor classifiers, respectively. The classification errors were analyzed and it was clear that some errors may be attributed to bad data, some to deformation and unbalanced proportion of digit segments, different writing styles of some digits, errors between digit pairs were specified and analyzed, and genuine errors. It was clear that the real misclassification of genuine data, in the case of HMM was nearly 1\%. This proves the effectiveness of the presented technique to writer-independent off-line Arabic (Indian) handwritten digit recognition. The technique is writer independent as separate writers' data were used in training of the classifiers and other writers' data were used in the testing phase.},

hypotheses are created for each touching group of digits and then

methodology lies in the fact that unnecessary segmentation cuts can
be identified without any attempt of classification by a general-purpose
classifier, reducing the number of paths in a segmentation graph,
what can consequently lead to a reduction in computational cost.
An cost-based approach using ROC (receiver operating characteristics)
was deployed to optimize the filter. Experimental results show that
the filter can eliminate up to 83\% of the unnecessary segmentation
hypothesis and increase the overall performance of the system.},

for an HMM based Arabic handwriting recognition system to handle
different handwriting styles and their variations. Additionally,
a writing variant model refinement for specific writing variants
is proposed. Current approaches try to compensate the impact of dif-
ferent writing styles during preprocessing and normaliza- tion steps.
Writer adaptive training with a CMLLR based feature adaptation is
used to train writer dependent models. An unsupervised writer clustering
with Bayesian information criterion based stopping condition for
a CMLLR based fea- ture adaptation during a two-pass decoding process
is used to cluster different handwriting styles of unknown test writ-
ers. The proposed methods are evaluated on the IFN/ENIT Arabic handwriting

abstract = {The problem addressed in this study is the offline recognition of handwritten Arabic city names. The names are assumed to belong to a fixed lexicon of about 1,000 entries. A state-of-the-art classical right-left hidden Markov model (HMM)-based recognizer (reference system) using the sliding window approach is developed. The feature set includes both baseline-independent and baseline-dependent features. The analysis of the errors made by the recognizer shows that the inclination, overlap, and shifted positions of diacritical marks are major sources of errors. In this paper, we propose coping with these problems. Our approach relies on the combination of three homogeneous HMM-based classifiers. All classifiers have the same topology as the reference system and differ only in the orientation of the sliding window. We compare three combination schemes of these classifiers at the decision level. Our reported results on the benchmark IFN/ENIT database of Arabic Tunisian city names give a recognition rate higher than 90 percent accuracy and demonstrate the superiority of the neural network-based combination. Our results also show that the combination of classifiers performs better than a single classifier dealing with slant-corrected images and that the approach is robust for a wide range of orientation angles.},

abstract = {This paper describes a technique for automatic recognition of off-line printed Arabic text using Hidden Markov Models. In this work different sizes of overlapping and nonoverlapping hierarchical windows are used to generate 16 features from each vertical sliding strip. Eight different Arabic fonts were used for testing (viz. Arial, Tahoma, Akhbar, Thuluth, Naskh, Simplified Arabic, Andalus, and Traditional Arabic). It was experimentally proven that different fonts have their highest recognition rates at different numbers of states (5 or 7) and codebook sizes (128 or 256). Arabic text is cursive, and each character may have up to four different shapes based on its location in a word. This research work considered each shape as a different class, resulting in a total of 126 classes (compared to 28 Arabic letters). The achieved average recognition rates were between 98.08\% and 99.89\% for the eight experimental fonts. The main contributions of this work are the novel hierarchical sliding window technique using only 16 features for each sliding window, considering each shape of Arabic characters as a separate class, bypassing the need for segmenting Arabic text, and its applicability to other languages.},

HMM for recognition and segmentation.


Details:
 The database was extracted from the books of Saheh Al-Bukhari and Saheh Muslem. The training phase, 2500 lines were used for
training and the remaining 266 lines for testing.
 For each file the text was formatted to appear as a white font color in a black background. Moreover, each image in the â€˜tifâ€™ file has been side reversed through a mirroring tool to speed up the training and recognition testing processes. Featrues are extracted from overlapping moving vertical window of three-pixel width and a text line of height TLH. from each window, 16 different feature are extracted by dividing the window into parts of non overlapping 8 parts of 1/8 height, 4 parts of 1/4 height and overlapping 1/2 height and one whole window. From each part, the number of black pixel is computed and used as feautres.


The HMM used is in HTK library, its structure allows nonlinear variations in the horizontal position. HTK models the feature vector with a mixture of Gaussians.
It uses the Viterbi algorithm in the recognition phase, which searches for the most likely sequence of a character given the input feature vector.

abstract = {Problems with local ambiguities in handwritten mathematical expressions
(MEs) are often resolved at global level. Therefore, keeping local
ambiguities is desirable for high accuracy, with a hope that they
may be resolved by later global analyses. We propose a layered search
framework for handwritten ME recognition. From given handwritten
input strokes, ME structures are expanded by adding symbol hypotheses
one by one, representing ambiguities of symbol identities and spatial
relationships as numbers of branches in the expansion. We also propose
a novel heuristic predicting how likely the set of remaining input
strokes forms valid spatial relationships with the current partially
interpreted structure. Further complexity reduction is achieved by
delaying the symbol identity decision. The elegance of our approach
is that the search result would be unchanged even if we prune out
unpromising branches of the search. Therefore, we can examine a much
larger number of local hypotheses with a limited amount of computing
resource in making global level decisions. The experimental evaluation
shows promising results of the efficiency of the proposed approach
and the performance of our system, which results from the system's
capacity to examine a large number of possibilities},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a multi-level recognizer for online Arabic
handwriting. In Arabic script (handwritten and printed), cursive
writing ï¿½ is not a style ï¿½ it is an inherent part of the script.
In addition, the connection between letters is done with almost no
ligatures, which complicates segmenting a word into individual letters.
In this work, we have adopted the holistic approach and avoided segmenting
words into individual letters. To reduce the search space, we apply
a series of filters in a hierarchicalmanner. The earlier filters
perform light processing on a large number of candidates, and the
later filters perform heavy processing on a small number of candidates.
In the first filter, global features and delayed strokes patterns
are used to reduce candidate word-part models. In the second filter,
local features are used to guide a dynamic time warping (DTW) classification.
The resulting k top ranked candidates are sent for shape-context
based classifier, which determines the recognized word-part. In this
work, we have modified the classic DTW to enable different costs
for the different operations and control their behavior. We have
performed several experimental tests and have received encouraging
results.},

To address this prob- lem, we propose a nonâ€“heuristic fast decoding algorithm which is based on hidden Markov model representation of characters. The decoding algorithm breaks up the compu- tation of word likelihoods into two levels: state level and character level. Given an observation sequence, the two level decoding enables the reuse of character likelihoods to decode all words in the lexicon, avoiding repeated compu- tation of state sequences. In an 80,000â€“word recognition task, the proposed decoding algorithm is about 15 times faster than a conventional Viterbi algorithm, while main- taining the same recognition accuracy},

A template vector was derived for each digit by taking the average feature vector of 30 handwritten sketches made by 30 different students. The test sketch is compared against all nine templates and a distance measure is performed to make the recognition. An overall hit ratio of 87.22\% was achieved in the preliminary results. The ratio reached IOO\% for some of the digits. But there was misinterpretation between similar digits like (7 and (9).

Using a hidden Markov model (HMM) representation of the scattered-waveform sequence, pose estimation reduces to estimating the underlyingHMMstates from a sequence of observations. It is assumed that each scattered waveform must be quantized via an encoding procedure. A distortionDis defined as the error in estimating the underlying HMM states, and the rate R represents the size of the discrete-HMM codebook. Rate-distortion theory is applied to define the minimum rate required to achieve a desired distortion, denoted as RÃ°DÃž. After deriving the rate-distortion function RÃ°DÃž, we demonstrate that discrete-HMMperformance based on Lloyd encoding is far from this bound. Performance is improved via block coding, based on Bayes VQ. Results are presented for acanonicalHMMproblem,andthen for multiaspect acoustic scatteringfrom underwater elastic targets.

To improve the accuracy of static handwriting recognition systems, many techniques aim to estimate dynamic information from the static scripts. Mostly, the pen trajectories of the scripts are estimated. However, the efficacy of the resulting pen trajectories are rarely evaluated quantitatively. This paper proposes a protocol for the objective evaluation of automatically determined pen trajectories. A hidden Markov model is derived from a ground-truth trajectory. An estimated trajectory is then matched to the derived model. Statistics describing substitution, insertion and deletion errors are then computed from this match. The proposed algorithm is especially useful for performance comparisons between different pen trajectory estimation algorithms. Â©},

abstract = {Handwritten word-spotting is traditionally viewed as an image matching task between one or multiple query word-images and a set of candidate word-images in a database. This is a typical instance of the query-by-example paradigm. In this article, we introduce a statistical framework for the word-spotting problem which employs hidden Markov models (HMMs) to model keywords and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for score normalization. We explore the use of two types of HMMs for the word modeling part: continuous HMMs (C-HMMs) and semi-continuous HMMs (SC-HMMs), i.e. HMMs with a shared set of Gaussians. We show on a challenging multi-writer corpus that the proposed statistical framework is always superior to a traditional matching system which uses dynamic time warping (DTW) for word- image distance computation. A very important finding is that the SC-HMM is superior when labeled training data is scarceâ€”as low as one sample per keywordâ€”thanks to the prior information which can be incorporated in the shared set of Gaussians.

the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between different sample distributions
and evaluate the optimality of individual ratio features. Then, the
boosting framework is adopted to select multiple ratio features iteratively.
Multiclass classification is handled by using a pairwise classification

recognition. In this paper we deal with the issue that part of features
originate from directional instead of common linear data. Both for
directional and linear data a theory for a statistical modeling exists.
However, none of these theories gives an integrated solution to problems,
where linear and directional variables are to be combined in a single,
multivariate probability density function. We describe a general
approach for a unified statistical modeling, given the constraint
that variances of the circular variables are small. The method is
practically evaluated in the context of our online handwriting recognition
system frog on hand and the so-called tangent slope angle feature.
Recognition results are compared with two alternative modeling approaches.
The proposed solution gives significant improvements in recognition
accuracy, computational speed and memory requirements},

First, we address the issue of how to perform OCR on omnifont and multi-style data, such as plain and italic, without the need to have a separate model for each style. The amount of training data from each style, which is used to train a single model, becomes an important issue in the face of the conditional independence assumption inherent in the use of HMMs. We demonstrate mathematically and empirically how to allocate training data among the different styles to alleviate this problem. Second, we show how to use a word-based HMM system to perform character recognition with unlimited vocabulary. The method includes the use of a trigram language model on character sequences. Using all these techniques, we have achieved character error rates of 1.1 percent on data from the University of Washington English Document Image Database and 3.3 percent on data from the DARPA Arabic OCR Corpus.},

abstract = {Researchers have extensively applied Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to handwritten recognition in English, Chinese, and other languages. Most researchers have been using the left-right topology for handwritten and speech recognition. This research studied the effect of HMM topology on isolated on- line Thai handwritten recognition. The left-right, fully connected and the proposed topologies (left-right-left) were compared. The number of state of a character HMM for each topology was varied from 15 to 35 nodes and the one with the best training observations probability was selected. The feature used was Chain code-like with modification to represent originated quadrant position. The recognition results showed that the proposed topology increases the recognition rate in comparison to the most widely used left-right topology.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel cascade ensemble classifier system for
the recognition of handwritten digits. This new system aims at attaining
a very high recognition rate and a very high reliability at the same
time, in other words, achieving an excellent recognition performance
of handwritten digits. The trade-offs among recognition, error, and
rejection rates of the new recognition system are analyzed. Three
solutions are proposed: (i) extracting more discriminative features
to attain a high recognition rate, (ii) using ensemble classifiers
to suppress the error rate and (iii) employing a novel cascade system
to enhance the recognition rate and to reduce the rejection rate.
Based on these strategies, seven sets of discriminative features
and three sets of random hybrid features are extracted and used in
the different layers of the cascade recognition system. The novel
gating networks (GNs) are used to congregate the confidence values
of three parallel artificial neural networks (ANNs) classifiers.
The weights of the GNs are trained by the genetic algorithms (GAs)
to achieve the overall optimal performance. Experiments conducted
on the MNIST handwritten numeral database are shown with encouraging
results: a high reliability of 99.96\% with minimal rejection, or
a 99.59\% correct recognition rate without rejection in the last cascade

abstract = {From the administrative point of view, cheque processing involves
all tasks a bank officer may perform to process an incoming cheque
for a client. This includes: accessing account numbers, verifying
names and signatures on the cheque, verifying the date of the cheque,
matching the legal amount with the courtesy amount and verifying
the credit of the cheque writer. However, from the technical point
of view, cheque processing could involve capturing the cheque image,
separating the foreground of the cheque from its background, extracting
fields of interest and recognizing each of them. This work employs
theories and methodologies from various fields ranging from Natural
language processing, Optical Character Recognition to Banking.

The motivation of the work on Cheque processing is not less than the
motivation of the entire research in artificial intelligence, which
aims to program the computer to carry out tedious routine processes,
freeing time and space for humans to perform tasks that require higher
levels of intelligence. A major advantage of such study is that it
can be easily adjusted to serve more than 20 different countries
(all of them use Arabic as their first language). In addition, legal
amounts are widely found in documents other than bank cheques (e.g.
business sell/purchase forms). Therefore, this study will be applicable
to a wide range of applications. Moreover, similar languages (e.g.
Urdu, Farisi) which use the same alphabet can benefit from these
studies.

The remaining sections provide a description of datasets available
for researchers as well as a detailed description of one system that

@phdthesis{ThesisSaid1997,
abstract = {Automatic processing of documents with the purpose to scan different
documents, recognize them, extract, and process different data items
obtained from them could be achieved by top-down and bottom-up approaches.
The former processes documents starting from the document class and
ends with the pixel representation of the different items that should
be extracted. The latter, however, processes documents in a reversed
manner. In this thesis, a top-down formal approach for automatic
processing of documents and bank cheques is proposed. This approach
will view a document as a hierarchy of related items: (a) the background
which contains simple or complex scenes that should be eliminated,
and (b) the foreground which contains (i) base lines that must be
removed and (ii) handwritten data, such as the date, the legal amount,
and the courtesy amount, that should be extracted with minimum distortion.
The novelty of this new approach is to eliminate the background,
first, by introducing a new recursive dynamic thresholding technique
that could be used globally or locally on a given cheque image. As
a second step, base lines that intersect the handwritten data are
recognized and removed with the challenge of minimizing the distortion
on the extracted items. Two methods are proposed to tackle this difficulty.
The first method detects the handwritten data that intersects with
the base lines that should be eliminated and uses morphological and
topological processing to identify and fill the gaps resulting from
the elimination of the detected base lines. The second method proposed
a new dynamic morphological processing technique which acts as a
detector and a preserver of the handwritten data that intersect,
with the base lines. The second method highly increased the efficiency
of item extraction by more than 80\% and enhanced the quality of the
extracted items when combined with local processing techniques. In
a step to study the reliability of the proposed top-down automatic
item extraction system, a quantitative analysis technique is investigated
and an experimental study is performed comparing the top-down formal
approach with another newly developed bottom-up approach using the
same training set of 500 real-life bank cheques and two testing sets
of 200 bank cheques obtained from the CENPARMI database. The purpose
of the quantitative performance analysis technique is to subject
the extracted items of the top-down and the bottom-up approaches
to the same item processing system that is able to recognize these
corresponding items and provide quantitative results to indicate
the reliability of both approaches. The experimental results showed
that the reliability of the top-down approach on the training set.
first testing set, and second testing set are 89.20\%, 87.91\%, and
90.10\% respectively while those on the bottom-up approach are 91.35\%,
91.30\%, and 93.10\%, respectively. Finally, in a step towards the
construction of a highly reliable system, a feasibility study has
been conducted by combining both approaches. The result is quite
encouraging and a reliability of 97.09\% has been achieved when these
two systems are combined},

for search applications. Traditional approaches for detecting NEs
in optical character recognition (OCR) output look for these NEs

of recognition errors in the single-best output, such approaches
usually result in low recall. Given that a lattice is more likely
to contain the correct answer, we explore NE detection from word
lattices produced by our Arabic handwriting recognition system. Since
the improvement in recall is accompanied by a large number of false

control precision. We show a 7\% improvement in true detects for the
same false acceptance rate on using lattices instead of 1-best hypothesis

abstract = {In this paper, we present a multi-stream approach for off-line handwritten word recognition. The pro- posed approach combines low level feature streams namely, density based features extracted from 2 dif- ferent sliding windows with different widths, and contour based features extracted from upper and lower contours. The multi-stream paradigm provides an interesting framework for the integration of multiple sources of information and is compared to the standard combination strategies namely fusion of repre- sentations and fusion of decisions. We investigate the extension of 2-stream approach to N streams (N =2, ... , 4) and analyze the improvement in the recognition performance. The computational cost of this extension is discussed. Significant experiments have been carried out on two publicly available word databases: IFN/ENIT benchmark database (Arabic script) and IRONOFF database (Latin script). The multi- stream framework improves the recognition performance in both cases. Using 2-stream approach, the best recognition performance is 79.8\%, in the case of the Arabic script, on a 2100-word lexicon consisting of 946 Tunisian town/village names. In the case of the Latin script, the proposed approach achieves a rec- ognition rate of 89.8\% using a lexicon of 196 words},

First, the rejection strategy for the single classifier is introduced,
which is composed of three stages: initial scaling, confidence measure
calculation, and rejection performing. Then, we analyze rejection
strategies for multiple classifiers. We divided our rejection strategies
into two categories: (1) for voting combination; and (2) for linear
combination with multiple classifiers. In the voting combination

And for the linear combination one, rejection strategies for average

Recently, a number of classifier creation and combination methods, known as ensemble methods, have been proposed in the field of machine learning. They have shown improved recognition performance over single classifiers. In this paper, we examine the influence of the vocabulary size, the number of training samples, and the number of classifiers on the performance of three ensemble methods in the context of cursive handwriting recognition. All experiments were conducted using an off-line handwritten word recognizer based on hidden Markov models (HMMs).},

abstract = {Neural network ensemble is a learning paradigm where many neural networks
are jointly used to solve a

problem. In this paper, the relationship between the ensemble and
its component neural networks is analyzed

from the context of both regression and classification, which reveals
that it may be better to ensemble many

instead of all of the neural networks at hand. This result is interesting
because at present, most approaches

ensemble all the available neural networks for prediction. Then, in
order to show that the appropriate neural

networks for composing an ensemble can be effectively selected from
a set of available neural networks, an

approach named GASEN is presented. GASEN trains a number of neural
networks at first. Then it assigns

random weights to those networks and employs genetic algorithm to
evolve the weights so that they can

characterize to some extent the fitness of the neural networks in
constituting an ensemble. Finally it selects

some neural networks based on the evolved weights to make up the ensemble.
A large empirical study shows

that, comparing with some popular ensemble approaches such as Bagging
and Boosting, GASEN can

generate neural network ensembles with far smaller sizes but stronger
generalization ability. Furthermore, in

order to understand the working mechanism of GASEN, the bias-variance
decomposition of the error is

provided in this paper, which shows that the success of GASEN may
lie in that it can significantly reduce the

bias as well as the variance.},

        Why read paper ?

HMM knowldege base.



        Paper Overview ?

HMM but focus on the difference of 1D HMM vs. the 2D HMM.
the features are build on filter masks.
offline and test only on seperate latin characters.



        What is these paper about ? (Summary)



The paper talks about the 1D HMM used to recognize characters int the following steps.

        Features extraction:

feature is a weighted sum of image where
F(i,j)= sum (sum ( w(i)I(i,j)). (f is features , w is the mask and I is the image pixel  see page 3 eq1  )
Uses 4 different sturctures (filters masks) called sptial Integrated filter). SIF to extract features from the image by sliding the structure throught the image and computing the features.



Recognition:

4 HMM models for each character is generated. The final recognition is computed as sum of 4 hmm probability and the class with Max probablity is the recognizied.



The results :



Latin hand printed characters are used to test (600 sample per class so 18,636  total samples)
comparisons between 2DHMM and 1D HMM methods the best result achieved is 1D HMM SIF 98\%
it is supposed to be less complex than 2D HMM.





        1. what are some advantages of this work ? What did you  find intersting (in a positive sense ) in the paper ?



Simple formulation of HMM.



        2. What can we take from this work  ? what do we learn ?  What can be incorporated into our own work ?






        3. What are the problems of the paper ?



The main problem is that it only test isolated characters, Simple features and also it seems that the high number of features for each mask.



        4. what is lacking from the work ? why does this work knot be the final  research in this subject ?

good filters, as the filters seems to only capture some of the spatial informaition it may be difficult to capture complex characters.





        5. what about the methods causes this lack ? is there a fundamental reason ?

The use of image and a masked filter it self.

        6. Could incremental Changes Fix this lack ? if so, what changes ?

More better features.



        Is there is any question you had about the paper ?






        The final conclusion..........



Small paper, that may provide simple HMM method to recognize character but restricted to latin only .

into two problems to solve simultaneously. To find the best matching
word for an input image, a Two-Tier Beam search is performed. In
Tier One, the search is constrained by a letter to PAW lexicon. In
Tier Two, the search is constrained by a PAW to word lexicon. The
searches are driven by a PAW recognizer. Experiments conducted on
the standard IFN/ENIT database [6] of handwritten Tunisian town names
show word error rates of about 11\%. This result compares to the results

abstract = {-A method for the off-line recognition of cursive handwriting based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) is described. The features used in the HMMs are based on the arcs of skeleton graphs of the words to be recognized. An algorithm is applied to the skeleton graph of a word that extracts the edges in a particular order. Given the sequence of edges extracted from the skeleton graph, each edge is transformed into a 10-dimensional feature vector. The features represent information about the location of an edge relative to the four reference lines, its curvature and the degree of the nodes incident to the considered edge. The linear model was adopted as basic HMM topology. Each letter of the alphabet is represented by a linear HMM. Given a dictionary of fixed size, an HMM for each dictionary word is built by sequential concatenation of the H M Ms representing the individual letters of the word. Training of the HM Ms is done by means of the Baum-Welch algorithm, while the Viterbi algorithm is used for recognition. An average correct recognition rate of over 98\% on the word level has been achieved in experiments with cooperative writers using two dictionaries of 150 words each.},

As there are more than 6,000 distinctive characters including Kanji and Hiragana in Japanese, modeling each character by an HMM leads to an infeasible character-recognition system requiring huge amount of memory and enormous computa- tion time. In order to tackle this problem, we have proposed the substroke HMM approach where a modeling unit â€œsub- strokeâ€� that is much smaller than a whole character is em- ployed and each character is modeled as a concatenation of only 25 kinds of substroke HMMs. One of the drawback of this approach is that the recognition accuracy deterio- rates in case of scribbled characters, and characters where the shape of the substrokes varies a lot. In this paper, we show that the context-dependent substroke modeling which depends on how the substroke connects to the adjacent sub- strokes is effective to achieve robust recognition of low qual- ity characters. The Successive State Splitting (SSS) algo- rithm which was mainly developed for speech recognition is employed to construct the context dependent substroke HMMs. Experimental results show that the correct recogni- tion rate improved from88\% to 92\% for cursive Kanji hand- writings and from 90\% to 98\% for Hiragana handwritings.},

on the k-NN rule to the automatic classification of handwritten characters.
The discriminating capacity of a k-NN classifier increases as the
size of the reference pattern set (RPS) increases. This supposes
aproblem for k-NN classifiers in real applications: the high computational
cost required when the RPS is large. In order to accelerate the process
of calculating the distance to each pattern of the RPS, some authors
propose the use of condensing techniques. These methods try to reduce
the size of the RPS without losing classification power. Our alternative
proposal is based on incremental learning and hierarchical classifiers
with rejection techniques that reduce the computational cost of the
classifier. We have used 133,944 characters (72,105 upper-case characters
and 61,839 lower-case characters) of the NIST Special Data Bases
3 and 7 as experimental data set. The binary image of the character
is transformed to gray image. The best non-hierarchical classifier
achieves a hit rate of 94.92\% (upper-case) and 87,884\% (lower-case).
The hierarchical classifier achieves the same hit ratio, but with
3 times lower computational cost than the cost of the best non-hierarchical
classifier found in our experimentation and 14\% less than Hart's

recognition. The basic idea of this approach is to employ a set of
left-right HMMs to generate a new feature vector as input, and then
use SNN as a classifier to finally identify unknown symbols. The
new feature vector consists of global features and several pairs
of maximum probabilities with their associated different model labels
for an observation pattern. A recogniser based on this method inherits
the practical and dynamical modeling abilities from HMM, and robust
discriminating ability from SNN for classification tasks. This hybrid
technique also reduces the dimensions of feature vectors significantly,
complexity, and solves size problem when using only SNN. The experimental
results show that this approach outperforms several classifiers reported
in recent research, and can achieve recognition rates of 97.41\%,
91.81\% and 91.63\% for digits and upper/lower case characters respectively

The model is constructed as a form of recognition network with HMMs for graphemes and Korean combination rules. Though the network represents the large character set efficiently and is flexible enough to accommodate variability of input patterns, it has a problem of recognition speed, caused by 11,172 search paths. To solve the problem, we modify a level building algorithm to be adapted directly to the Korean combination rules and apply it to the model. The modified algorithm is an efficient network search procedure, the time complexity of which depends on the number of grapheme HMMs and ligature HMMs, not the number of paths in the extensive recognition network. A test with 20,000 handwritten characters shows a recognition rate of 90.2\% and speed of 0.72 s per character. Â©},

The amount of training data from each style, which is used to train a single model, becomes an important issue in the face of the conditional independence assumption inherent in the use of HMMs. We demonstrate mathematically and empirically how to allocate training data among the different styles to alleviate this problem. Second, we show how to use a word-based HMM system to perform character recognition with unlimited vocabulary. The method includes the use of a trigram language model on character sequences. Using all these techniques, we have achieved character error rates of 1.1\% on data from the University of Washington English Document Image Database and 3.3\% on data from the DARPA Arabic OCR Corpus.},

false rejection rates. Generally, the adoption of a Bayesian parametric
model does not allow for obtaining explicit expressions for the calculation

concerned, some hypotheses can be reasonably adopted, thus allowing
simple and affordable expressions to be derived. By using two verification

For this purpose, we first extract structural features from the words
contained in the amounts vocabulary. Then, we build a symbolic knowledge
base that reflects a classification of words according to their features.
In a third step, we use a translation algorithm (from rules to neural
network) to determine the neural network architecture and to initialize
its connections with specific values rather than random values, as
is the case in classical neural networks. This construction approach
provides the network with theoretical knowledge and reduces the training
stage, which remains necessary because of styles and writing conditions
variability. After this empirical training stage using real examples,
the network acquires a final topology, which allows it to recognize
new handwritten amounts.},

Bangla characters, in: Proceedings of the ICVGIP-06, Lecture Notes

segments a word image on Matra hierarchy, then recognizes the individual
word segments and finally identifies the constituent characters of
the word image through intelligent combination of recognition decisions
of the associated word segments. Due to possible appearances of consecutive
characters of Bangla words on overlapping character positions, segmentation
of Bangla word images is not easy. For successful OCR of handwritten
Bangla text, not only recognition but also segmentation of word images
are important. In this respect the present hierarchical approach
deals with both segmentation and recognition of handwritten Bangla
word images for a complete solution to handwritten word recognition
problem, an essential area of OCR of handwritten Bangla text. In
dealing with certain category of word segments, created on Matra
hierarchy, a sophisticated recognition technique, viz., two-pass
approach [S. Basu, C. Chaudhury, M. Kundu, M. Nasipuri, D.K. Basu,
A two pass approach to pattern classification, in: N.R. Pal et al.
(Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 3316, ICONIP, Kolkata,
2004, pp. 781ï¿½786] is employed here. The degree of sophistication
of the classification technique is also rationally tuned depending
on various categories of word segments to be recognized. For example,
the two-pass approach is employed here for recognizing middle zone
character segments, whereas recognition of middle zone modified shapes
of Bangla script is done through simple template matching. Considering
learning and generalization abilities of multi layer perceptrons
(MLPs), MLP based pattern classifiers are used here for most of the
classification related tasks. A powerful feature set is also designed
under this work for recognition of complex character patterns using
three types of topological features, viz., longest-run features,
modified shadow features and octant-centroid features. In a nutshell,
the work deals with a practical problem of OCR of Bangla text involving
recognition as well as segmentation of constituent characters of
handwritten Bangla words.},

abstract = {Urdu script-based languagesâ€™ character recognition has some technical issues not existing in other lan- guages and makes these languages more complicated. Segmentation-based character recognition approach for handwritten Urdu, both Nastaâ€™liq and Nasakh script-based languages, incorporates number of overhead and very less accurate as compared to segmentation free. This paper presents a segmenta- tion-free approach for recognition of online Urdu handwritten script using hybrid classifier, HMM and fuzzy logic. Trained data set consisting of HMMs for each stroke is further classified into 62 sub-patterns based on the primary stroke shape at the beginning and end using fuzzy rule. Fuzzy linguistic variables based on language structure are used to model features and provide suitable result for large variation in handwritten strokes. Twenty-six time variant structural and statistical features are extracted for the base strokes. The fuzzy classification into sub-patterns increases the efficiency and decreases the computa- tional complexity due to reduction in data set size. The hybrid HMMâ€“fuzzy technique is efficient for large and complex data set. It provided 87.6\% and 74.1\% for Nastaâ€™liq and Nasakh, respectively, on 1800 ligatures. î€‚},

of an unknown query that match similar segments of labeled reference
words. Recognition is based on the correspondence between the order
of the feature vectors and of the lexical transcript in both the
query and the references. SIC implicitly incorporates language context
in the form of letter n-grams. SCC is based on the notion that the
style (distortion or noise) of a character is a good predictor of
the distortions arising in other characters, even of a different
class, from the same source. It is adaptive in the sense that, with
a long-enough field, its accuracy converges to that of a style-specific
classifier trained on the writer of the unknown query. Neither SIC
nor SCC requires the query words to appear among the references.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a simple voting scheme for off-line recognition
of handprinted numerals. One of the main features of the proposed
scheme is that this is not script dependent. Another interesting
feature is that it is sufficiently fast for real-life applications.
In contrast to the usual practices, here we studied the efficiency
of a majority voting approach when all the classifiers involved are
multilayer perceptron (MLP) of different sizes and respective features
are based on wavelet transforms at different resolution levels. The
rationale for this approach is to explore how one can improve the
recognition performance without adding much to the requirements for
computational time and resources. For simplicity and efficiency,
in the present work, we considered only three coarse-to-fine resolution
levels of wavelet representation. We primarily simulated the proposed
technique on a database of off-line handprinted Bangla (a major Indian
script) numerals. We achieved 97.16\% correct recognition rate on
a test set of 5000 Bangla numerals. In this simulation we used two
other disjoint sets (one for training and the other for validation
purpose) of sizes 6000 and 1000 respectively. We have also tested
our approach on MNIST database for handwritten English digits. The
result is comparable with state-of-the-art technologies.},

trained to separate different classes of digits. Support vector machine
are based on the concept of decision planes that defines the decision

in four steps 1) Preprocessing 2) Feature extraction 3) Classification
4) detection. A database of 100 different representation of each
digit is constructed for the training database. The digits are first
manually segmented into 5 classes to minimize the time required to
obtain the hyperplane. Then the input is again check against the
two classes by 2-class SVM classifier. Experiments show that the

the MFS features are suitable for Arabic character recognition. Average
recognition rate of 95.9\% was achieved for the model classes. The
analysis of the errors indicates that this recognition rate can be
improved by using the ï¿½holeï¿½ feature of a character and use cleaning
corrupted data.},

abstract = {The segmentation and recognition of Arabic handwritten text has been an area of great interest in the past few years. However, a small number of research papers and reports have been published in this area due to the dificult problems associated with Arabic handwritten text processing. In this work a technique is presented that segments handwritten Arabic text. A conventional algorithm is used for the initial segmentation of the text into connected blocks of characters. The algorithm then generates pre- segmentation points for these blocks. A neural network is subsequently used to verify the accuracy of these segmentation points. Two major problems were encountered: The segmentation phase proved to be successful in vertical segmentation of connected blocks of characters. However, it couldnâ€™t segment characters that were overlapping horizontally. Second, segmentation of handwritten Arabic text depends largely on contextual information, and not only on topographic features extracted from these characters.},

Experimental results show the prominence of the

proposed features. The best recognition rate is obtained by

using the PCA algorithm for equalizing the feature vectors

abstract = {There are many uncertainties in handwritten character recognition. Stochastic modeling is a flexible and general method for modeling such problems and entails the use of probabilistic models to deal with uncertain or incomplete information. This paper presents an efficient scheme for off-line recognition of large-set handwritten characters in the framework of stochastic models, the first-order hidden Markov models (HMMs). To facilitate the processing of unconnected patterns and patterns with isolated noises, four types of feature vectors based on the regional projection contour transformation (RPCT) are employed. The recognition system consists of two phases. For each character, in the training phase, multiple HMMs corresponding to different feature types of RPCT are built. In the classification phase, the results of individual classifiers to produce the final recognition result for an input character are integrated, where each individual HMM classifier produces one score that is the probability of generating the test observation sequence for each character model. In this paper, several methods for integrating the results of different classifiers are considered so that a better result could be obtained. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the most frequently used 520 types of Hangul characters in Korea have been considered in the experiments. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme is very promising for the recognition of large-set handwritten characters with numerous variations},

abstract = {The difficulties in segmenting cursive words into individual characters
have shifted the focus of handwriting recognition research from segmentation-based
approaches to segmentation-free (holistic) methods. However, maintaining
and training large number of prototypes (models) that represent the
words in the dictionary make the training process extremely expensive
and difficult in computing resources. In this paper we present an
efficient system that automatically generates prototypes for each
word in a given dictionary using multiple appearance of each letter
shape. Multiple appearance allows for many permutation of shapes
for each word and thus complicates searching for the right prototype.
To simplify the training, reduce the maintained prototypes, and avoid
over fitting, we used dimensionality reduction followed by clustering
techniques to reduce the size of these sets without affecting their
ability to represent the wide variations of the handwriting styles.
A set of generated fonts are created by professional writers imitating
all handwriting styles for each character in each position. These
fonts are used to generate all shapes for writing each word-part
in a comprehensive dictionary. Principal component analysis and k-means
clustering techniques are performed to select the minimal number
of shapes representing the wide variations of handwriting styles
for a word-part. Experimental results using an online recognition
system proves the credibility of this process compared to manually
generated databases.},

abstract = {Nearest neighbor search is commonly employed in face recognition but
it does not scale well to large dataset sizes. A strategy to combine
rejection classifiers into a cascade for face identification is proposed
in this paper. A rejection classifier for a pair of classes is defined
to reject at least one of the classes with high confidence. These
rejection classifiers are able to share discriminants in feature
space and at the same time have high confidence in the rejection
decision. In the face identification problem, it is possible that
a pair of known individual faces are very dissimilar. It is very
unlikely that both of them are close to an unknown face in the feature
space. Hence, only one of them needs to be considered. Using a cascade
structure of rejection classifiers, the scope of nearest neighbor
search can be reduced significantly. Experiments on Face Recognition
Grand Challenge (FRGC) version 1 data demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves significant speed up and an accuracy comparable with
the brute force Nearest Neighbor method. In addition, a graph cut
based clustering technique is employed to demonstrate that the pairwise
separability of these rejection classifiers is capable of semantic
grouping},

abstract = {Abstract. The research on offline handwritten Arabic character recognition
has received more and more attention in recent years, because of
the increasing needs of Arabic document digitization. The variation
in Arabic handwriting brings great difficulty in character segmentation
and recognition, eg., the subparts (diacritics) of the Arabic character
may shift away from the main part. In this paper, a new probabilistic
segmentation model is proposed. First, a contourbased over-segmentation
method is conducted, cutting the word image into graphemes. The graphemes
are sorted into 3 queues, which are character main parts, sub-parts
(diacritics) above or below main parts respectively. The confidence
for each character is calculated by the probabilistic model, taking
into account both of the recognizer output and the geometric confidence
besides with logical constraint. Then, the global optimization is
conducted to find optimal cutting path, taking weighted average of
character confidences as objective function. Experiments on handwritten
Arabic documents with various writing styles show the proposed method
is effective},

The proposed method is analytic without segmentation, and is able to cope with handwriting inclination and with shifted positions of diacritical marks. First, the recognition stage relies on 3 classifiers based on hidden Markov modelling (HMM). The second stage depends on the combination of these classifiers. The feature vectors used for recognition are related to pixel density distribution and to local pixel configurations. These vectors are extracted on word binary images by using a sliding window approach with different angles. We have experimented different combination schemes. The neural network-based combined system yields best performance on the IFN- ENIT benchmark data base of handwritten names of Tunisian villages/towns.},

abstract = {The difficulties in segmenting cursive words into individual characters
have shifted the focus of handwriting recognition research from segmentation-based
approaches to segmentation-free (holistic) methods. However, maintaining
and training large number of prototypes (models) that represent the
words in the dictionary make the training process extremely expensive
and difficult in computing resources. In this paper we present an
efficient system that automatically generates prototypes for each
word in a given dictionary using multiple appearance of each letter
shape. Multiple appearance allows for many permutation of shapes
for each word and thus complicates searching for the right prototype.
To simplify the training, reduce the maintained prototypes, and avoid
over fitting, we used dimensionality reduction followed by clustering
techniques to reduce the size of these sets without affecting their
ability to represent the wide variations of the handwriting styles.
A set of generated fonts are created by professional writers imitating
all handwriting styles for each character in each position. These
Fonts are used to generate all shapes for writing each word-part
in a comprehensive dictionary. Principal component analysis and k-means
clustering techniques are performed to select the minimal number
of shapes representing the wide variations of handwriting styles
for a word-part. Experimental results using an online recognition
system proves the credibility of this process compared to manually
generated databases.},

for each image. A fuzzy membership function is then used to estimate
the likelihood of these primitives being close to the two vertical

applied to classify the numerals. With our system, handwritten numerals

The baseline approach combines a Markov Random Field (MRF) and a HMM so-called Non-Symmetric Half Plane HiddenMarkovModel (NSHP-HMM). To improve the results performed by this baseline system operating just on low-level pixel information an extension of the NSHP-HMM is proposed. The mechanism allows to extend the observations of the NSHP-HMM by implanting structural information in the system.

abstract = {This paper describes a technique for automatic recognition of off-line printed Arabic text using Hidden Markov Models. In this work different sizes of overlapping and non- overlapping hierarchical windows are used to generate 16 features from each vertical sliding strip. Eight different Arabic fonts were used for testing (viz. Arial, Tahoma, Akhbar, Thuluth, Naskh, Simplified Arabic, Andalus, and Traditional Arabic). It was experimentally proven that different fonts have their highest recognition rates at different numbers of states (5 or 7) and codebook sizes (128 or 256). Arabic text is cursive, and each charactermay have up to four different shapes based on its location in a word. This research work considered each shape as a different class, resulting in a total of 126 classes (compared to 28 Arabic letters). The achieved average recognition rates were between 98.08\% and 99.89\% for the eight experimental fonts. The main contributions of this work are the novel hierarchical sliding window technique using only 16 features for each sliding window, considering each shape of Arabic characters as a separate class, bypassing the need for segmenting Arabic text, and its applicability to other languages.},

The features were chosen because they are somewhat orthogonal and are at different scales to each other. Collectively,these features are known as the gradient, structural, and concavity (GSC)feature set


[ Interesting Dividing digit images into segmetns ... ] The first step in the GSC feature extraction algorithm is to divide the imageinto nXm grids with equal number of foreground pixels for each of n rows,and equal number of foreground pixels for each of m columns. A digit sample is segmented into n horizontal segments with approximately equal number of black(foreground)pixels in each segment. The system then segments the digit into m vertical slices with approximately equal number of black (foreground) pixels. the intersection of horizontal and verticalsegmentation lines define (n*m) non-overlapping segments that are used to extract the features in each segment. the segment sizes and x- and y-coordinates are different for each different sample based on the sample black(foreground)pixelsâ€™ distribution.


Three set of features is computed for each segment ( Gradiaent features (sobel operator), Structual Featrues ( densisty features , stroke features, ...), Concativity shape features). Table 1 in page 1180 shows the details of each feature.

abstract = {A successful approach to the recognition of Latin characters is to
extract fiatures from that character such as the number of strokes,
stroke intersections and holes, and to use ad-hoc tests to diflerentiate
between characters which have similar features. The first stage in
this process ib to produce thinned 1 pixel thick representations
of the characters to simplifi feature extraction. This approach works
well with printed Latin characters which are of high quality. With
poor quality characters, however, the thinning process itself is
not, straighrfonvard and can introduce errors which clre manfested
in the later stages of the recognition process. The recognition of
poor quality Arabic characters is a particular problem since the
chara(5tet-s are calligraphic with printed characters having widely
varying stroke thicknesses to simulate the drawing of the character
with a calligraphy pen or brush. This paper describes the problems
encountered when thinning large poor quality Arabic characters prior
to the extraction of their features and submission to a syntactic
recognition system.},

abstract = {Various form features affect consumer preference regarding product
design. It is, therefore, important that designers identify these
critical form features to aid them in developing appealing products.
However, the problems inherent in choosing product form features
have not yet been intensively investigated. In this paper, an approach
based on multiclass support vector machine recursive feature elimination
(SVM-RFE) is proposed to streamline the selection of optimum product
form features. First, a one-versus-one (OVO) multiclass fuzzy support
vector machines (multiclass fuzzy SVM) model using a Gaussian kernel
was constructed based on product samples from mobile phones. Second,
an optimal training model parameter set was determined using two-step
cross-validation. Finally, a multiclass SVM-RFE process was applied
to select critical form features by either using overall ranking
or class-specific ranking. The weight distribution of each iterative
step can be used to analyze the relative importance of each of the
form features. The results of our experiment show that the multiclass
SVM-RFE process is not only very useful for identifying critical
form features with minimum generalization errors but also can be
used to select the smallest feature subset for building a prediction
model with a given discrimination capability.},

Furthermore, for both recognizers, subsets have been identified that outper- form the reference system with statistical significance.

First, some global parameters, such as slant angle, baselines, stroke width and height, are estimated. Second, a segmentation method finds character segmentation paths by combining gray-scale and binary information. Third, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed for shape recognition to label and rank the character candidates. For this purpose, a string of codes is extracted from each segment to represent the character candidates. The estimation of feature space parameters is embedded in the HMM training stage together with the estimation of the HMM model parameters. Finally, information from a lexicon and from the HMM ranks is combined in a graph optimization problem for word-level recognition. This method corrects most of the errors produced by the segmentation and HMM ranking stages by maximizing an information measure in an efficient graph search algorithm.

context of Brazilian bank checks, specifically the months of the
year, and no restrictions are placed on the types or styles of writing

of artificial neural networks (ANN) are evaluated for classification
of the words. The objectives are to evaluate the performance of conventional

to develop a rejection mechanism based on multiple thresholds, and
to analyze the behavior of the feature set proposed in the two architectures.
The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the class-modular
architecture over the conventional MLP architecture. A rejection
mechanism with multiple thresholds demonstrates favorable performance
in both architectures. The feature set analysis shows the importance
of the structural primitives such as concavities and convexities,
and perceptual primitives such as ascenders and descenders. The experimental
results reveal a recognition rate of 81.75\% without the rejection
mechanism, and a reliability rate 91.52\% with a rejection rate of

abstract = {
Structural analysis in handwritten mathematical expressions focuses on interpreting the recognized symbols using geometrical information such as relative sizes and positions of the symbols. Most existing approaches rely on hand-crafted grammar rules to identify semantic relationships among the recognized mathematical symbols. They could easily fail when writing errors occurred. Moreover, they assume the availability of the whole mathematical expression before being able to analyze the semantic information of the expression. To tackle these problems, we propose a progressive structural analysis (PSA) approach for dynamic recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions. The proposed PSA approach is able to provide analysis result immediately after each written input symbol. This has an advantage that users are able to detect any recognition errors immediately and correct only the mis-recognized symbols rather than the whole expression. Experiments conducted on 57 most commonly used mathematical expressions have shown that the PSA approach is able to achieve very good performance results.},

abstract = {Detection of recognition errors is important in many areas, suchas
improving recognition performance, saving manual effort for proof-reading
and post-editing, and assigning appropriate weights for retrieval
in constructing digital libraries.We propose a novel application
of multiple classifiers for the detection of recognition errors.
A need for multiple classifiers emerges when a single classifier
cannot improve recognition-error detection performance compared with
the current detection scheme using a simple threshold mechanism.
Although the single classifier does not improve recognition error
performance, it serves as a baseline for comparison and the related
study of useful features for error detection suggests three distinct
cases where improvement is needed. For eachcase, the multiple classifier
approachassigns a classifier to detect the presence or absence of
errors and additional features are considered for each case. Our
results show that the recall rate (70ï¿½80\%) of recognition errors,
the precision rate (80ï¿½90\%) of recognition error detection and the
saving in manual effort (75\%) were better than the corresponding
performance using a single classifier or a simple threshold detection
scheme},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe an off-line unconstrained handwritten Arabic word recognition system based on segmentation-free approach and semi-continuous hidden Markov models (SCHMMs) with explicit state duration. Character durations play a significant part in the recognition of cursive handwriting. The duration information is still mostly disregarded in HMM-based automatic cursive handwriting rec- ognizers due to the fact that HMMs are deficient in modeling character durations properly. We will show experimentally that explicit state duration modeling in the SCHMM framework can significantly improve the discriminating capacity of the SCHMMs to deal with very difficult pattern recognition tasks such as unconstrained handwritten Arabic recognition. In order to carry out the letter and word model training and recognition more efficiently, we propose a new version of the Viterbi algorithm taking into account explicit state duration modeling. Three distributions (Gamma, Gauss and Poisson) for the explicit state duration modeling have been used and a comparison between them has been reported. To perform word recognition, the described system uses an original sliding window approach based on vertical projection histogram analysis of the word and extracts a new pertinent set of statistical and structural features from the word image. Several experi- ments have been performed using the IFN/ENIT benchmark database and the best recognition perfor- mances achieved by our system outperform those reported recently on the same database.},

abstract = {In sign language recognition (SLR), the major challenges now are developing methods that solve signer-independent continuous sign problems. In this paper, SOFM/HMM is first presented for modeling signer-independent isolated signs. The proposed method uses the self-organizing feature maps (SOFM) as different signersâ€™ feature extractor for continuous hidden Markov models (HMM) so as to transform input signs into significant and low-dimensional representations that can be well modeled by the emission probabilities of HMM. Based on these isolated sign models, a SOFM/SRN/HMM model is then proposed for signer-independent continuous SLR. This model applies the improved simple recurrent network (SRN) to segment continuous sign language in terms of transformed SOFM representations, and the outputs of SRN are taken as the HMM states in which the latticeViterbi algorithm is employed to search the best matched word sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system has better performance compared with conventional HMM system and obtains a word recognition rate of 82.9\% over a 5113-sign vocabulary and an accuracy of 86.3\% for signer-independent continuous SLR. î€� 2004 Pattern Recognition Society.

read subsequently by human eyes or other more advanced automated

is more difficult to deal with, in terms of costs and time involved
to rectify the mistake. As such, our architecture can be geared towards
producing the most suitable balance between inaccurate readings and
rejection level, in accordance with user preferences. The experimental

results for a particular database of previous termchecks;next term

The achieved average recognition rates were 99.83\% and 99.00\% using, respectively, the SVM and HMM classifiers. SVM recognition rates proved to be better for all digits. Comparison at the writerâ€™s level (Writers 34 to 44) showed that SVM results outperformed HMM results for all tested writers. The classification errors of the SVM classifier were analyzed.

Why read paper ?



Svm and hmm with digit comparision.



        Paper Overview ?

it is arabic digits offlin system uses different types of features (gradient, concavity and density ) then use either SVM and HMM classifiers.



What is these paper about ? (Summary)



First

        preprocessing:

The image is binirized using threshold algorithm,
Segment division:
the binarized image is divided into segments of 3X3 or nXm grid.
The size of each segment is not equal, nxn grid is generted with equal number of pixle in each column or row (see figure 3).
The image is divided that In each n row the number of black pixels  are the same. (same is done for column)



        Features extraction:

Features is computed for each segment as following:
a) gradinet features
Sobel operator is used to get the directional grandient of the direction. Then direction is divided into 12 regions (degree). the histogram of each region is computed for each segment based on the calculated gradient direction.
b) structural features
A set of 12  rules that capture the mini strokes features are computed. ( each rule check the neighbourhood of each pixel and there shapes).
(see table 1. )
c) concavity features
 consist of segment desnity of black segments ,  maximum vertical and horizontal strokes
and  concavity featuers

        Classification and recognition:

Two classifier were experiement SVM and HMM
the SVM RBF model was used to recognize the characters
as for  HMM , model for each digit is used with viterbi algorithm to get max likely segment (digit).  As the system use no sliding windows ,  and the features are computed on the whole image, the features set is split into 10 observation sequence. and presented to the HMM in sequence.



        Result:

Dataset of 44 writers with 10 digits and 48 sample per user. so 21,000  nearly samples.
SVM (99.83\%) result better than HMM (99.0\%)
 A comparison with different features vectors are used and the best result with using all features (GSC)..
different result based on number of states in HMM and SVM paramters.
Seperate dcigits analysis to wrong digits.



        1. what are some advantages of this work ? What did you  find intersting (in a positive sense ) in the paper ?



Using previouly simple image based features with HMM by spliting the feature vectors and using one HMM per digit.
also a good comparision betweeen HMM and RBF SVM.



2. What can we take from this work  ? what do we learn ?  What can be incorporated into our own work ?

 We can use the image based features used on character recognition with HMM. ( same feature used in SVM).
The division of grid based on number of pixel captures the location of interest (gives a good division than equal distance grid).



3. What are the problems of the paper ?



Maybe the division of digits ( is it better than equal distance or is it better based on number of pixels ) it need more investigation.



        4. what is lacking from the work ? why does this work knot be the final  research in this subject ?



It is good paper nearly lacking nothing.  It may need some testing on other dataset and other languages and application on chracters not digits.



        5. what about the methods causes this lack ? is there a fundamental reason ?




        6. Could incremental Changes Fix this lack ? if so, what changes ?






        Is there is any question you had about the paper ?






The final conclusion..........



Good paper with good analysis of error and final result of 99.83\%  on arabic digits.
Also the basic idea of spliting feature vector to present it to HMM, and the use of same feature for both SVM and HMM.

abstract = {This thesis presents a study to process Arabic handwritten cheques. It includes the development of a unique set of databases that constitute a solid base for research in this domain. The databases are unique in terms of their source, domain and tags validation process. First, they are originated from real-world bank cheques, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reached in a university setting. Second, it constitutes the only databases in the domain of Arabic handwritten cheques so far. To the best of our knowledge, there is no database that provides training and testing samples for Arabic cheques. Third, it involved a unique tagging validation process that takes advantage of the embedded redundancy in the format of the cheque to verify the tagging process. A grammar to validate Arabic legal amounts and translate them to numerical values is also included. This work includes an efficient method to derive one-dimensional feature sequence that preserves the dynamics of the original two-dimensional images. This is very important to accommodate small variations while modeling two-dimensional signals. The thesis provides a detailed description of an improved graph representation of sub-word images, a more efficient method to extract dynamic information from two-dimensional images and a clear positioning of the applicability of other curve-ordering criteria, e.g. vision rules. In addition, this thesis includes a significant improvement in the discrimination power of HMM which allows the differentiation between short sub-words and longer ones that share significant initial observation sequences. It also allows the HMM to properly classify incomplete observation sequences. The improvement is achieved by introducing a new parameter to the HMM called the termination probability. Included in this work are tests that prove the applicability and efficiency of the above contributions. At the time of this dissertation, our survey indicates that this work is the only research in the literature which handles images of handwritten sub-words extracted from Arabic cheques. The results of this study show a 94.36\% sub-word recognition rate on the top 10 choices. Error analysis indicates some errors caused by the pre-processing (48\%), feature extraction (28\%) and classification (24\%) modules},

transition features (horizontally and vertically) for discriminating
between two overlapping classes (0 and 1). To separate another overlapping
group containing three numerals 2, 3 and 4 we first eliminate common
parts of these digits (tail) and then compute chain code features.
We employ SVM classifier for the classification and evaluate our
scheme on 80,000 handwritten samples of Persian numerals [10]. Using
60,000 samples for training, we tested our scheme on other 20,000
samples and obtained 99.02\% accuracy.},

@article{Arica2002a,
abstract = {Character recognition (CR) has been extensively studied in the last half century and progressed to a level sufficient to produce tech- nology driven applications. Now, the rapidly growing computational power enables the implementation of the presentCRmethodologies and creates an increasing demand on many emerging application domains, which require more advanced methodologies. This material serves as a guide and update for readers working in the CR area. First, the historical evolution of CR systems is presented. Then, the available CR techniques with their superiorities and weaknesses are reviewed. Finally, the current status of CR is discussed, and directions for future research are suggested. Special attention is given to the off-line hand- writing recognition since this area requires more research to reach the ul- timate goal of machine simulation of human reading},

abstract = {Automatic recognition of Arabic handwritten text is a problem worth
solving; it gained more and more interest in recent years, for various
reasons. In this paper we address the most frequently encountered
problems when dealing with Arabic handwriting recognition and we
briefly present lessons learnt from several serious attempts that
have been undertaken in this regard. We give a summary of techniques
concerning Arabic handwriting recognition research. We will end by
a case study, recognition of Tunisian city names, emphasizing on
visual-based strategies for Arabic handwriting recognition (AHR).},

@incollection{ARAbdelRaouf2008,
abstract = {Electronic Document Management (EDM) technology is being widely adopted
as it makes for the efficient routing and retrieval of documents.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an important front end for
such technology. Excellent OCR now exists for Latin based languages,
but there are few systems that read Arabic, which limits the penetration
of EDM into Arabicspeaking countries. In developing an OCR system
for Arabic it is necessary to create a database of Arabic words.
Such a database has many uses as well as in training and testing
a recognition system. This paper provides a comprehensive study and
analysis of Arabic words and explains how such a database was constructed.
Unlike earlier studies, this paper describes a database developed
using a large number of collected Arabic words (6 million). It also
considers connected segments or Pieces of Arabic Words (PAWs) as
well as Naked Pieces of Arabic Word (NPAWs); PAWS without diacritic
Background information concerning the Arabic language is also presented.},

@article{Camastra2007,
abstract = {This paper presents a cursive character recognizer, a crucial module in any cursive word recognition system based on a segmentation and recognition approach. The character classification is achieved by using support vector machines (SVMs) and a neural gas. The neural gas is used to verify whether lower and upper case version of a certain letter can be joined in a single class or not. Once this is done for every letter, the character recognition is performed by SVMs. A database of 57 293 characters was used to train and test the cursive character recognizer. SVMs compare notably better, in terms of recognition rates, with popular neural classifiers, such as learning vector quantization and multi-layer-perceptron. SVM recognition rate is among the highest presented in the literature for cursive character recognition},

images written on Brazilian bank cheques. The system first segments
implicitly a date image into sub-fields through the recognition process

strategy is proposed to recognize the three obligatory date sub-fields
(day, month and year) using different classifiers. Markovian and
neural approaches have been adopted to recognize and verify words
and strings of digits respectively. We also introduce the concept
of meta-classes of digits, which is used to reduce the lexicon size
of the day and year and improve the precision of their segmentation
and recognition. Experiments show interesting results on date recognition.},

@article{Beldjehem2009,
abstract = {We propose a novel cognitively motivated unifying framework for Arabic handwriting recognition that takes into account the nature of the human reading process of Arabic handwriting. This Modular Granular Architecture tackles the problem by observing Arabic handwriting from both perceptual and linguistic points of view and hence analyzes the underlying input signal from different granularity levels. It is based on three levels of abstraction: a low granularity level that uses perceptual features called global visual indices, a medium granularity level that is the conventional recognition stage and a high granularity level that consists on morphological analysis dedicated to segmentation/recognition. The original idea is the effective use of Arabic wordâ€™s morphology in the recognition not only in post-processing. This architecture carries well around the Arabic wordâ€™s morphology, as typically in Arabic, the Arabic wordâ€™s morphology is by excellence the logical structure (even semantic) of a given Arabic word, whereas the visual data constitute the physical geometric (topological) structure of a given word. We need to integrate both of them for an effective cooperative recognition of Arabic Handwriting. This framework subsumes the lexicon-driven approaches; in that it can recognize a word that does not exist within the lexicon.},
