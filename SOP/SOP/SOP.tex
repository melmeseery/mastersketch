  I dream of participating in building a world-class research in Egypt, my country. I am confident that both my experiences in the academic (as a Research Assistant) and industrial (as a Software Engineer) sectors provided me with the necessary background to pursue my dream. Throughout my work as a research assistant I have published various papers in different research areas. I also have hand-on experiences in software development in different commercial sectors. Applying to a PhD program in your esteemed institute is a step towards achieving my goal. I have an immense interest in the research conducted in CENPARMI. I believe that the Department of Computer Science at the Concordia University is the most suitable place for me to pursue my PhD.

 My interest in research started early through my undergraduate study which impelled me to look for a research problem my graduation project. I choose my project to be ``Face recognition and Identification'' where I investigated various face recognition and skin detection methods. This project showed me what it meant to work in research and how to handle the frustration of wrong or unexplained result. On the other hand, the thrill and the continuous motivation to gain more information, ideas help investigating more creative problem solving techniques. In short, I knew then that I want to continue to work in the scientific research career.


 After realizing my dream I strived to work researcher in an academic institute. Therefore, since 2007, I have been affiliated with the 'Signal and Image Processing' research group in the Electronic Research Institute (ERI), Egypt. The position offered a research environment which I believe is essential for conducting any constructive research. My work in ERI focused on investigating and evaluating the use of Swarm Intelligence in field of Image processing. I also worked on integrating this work with my Master's thesis in Sketch Recognition and Understanding. I worked on evaluating the efficiency of different Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms on segmenting users hand drawn sketch. ERI helped me to engage in research discussions and projects that opened my mind to other fields of research other than my own, which provide me with a breadth of information that will definitely help me as a researcher in the long term.

 	Although my dream was to become a scientific researcher, I believed that I need some practical experience. Thus, I worked for four years as a Software Engineer in EngNet Company, Egypt. During my work I was engaged in various discussions and negotiations that taught me how to resolve conflicts and compromise to reach a final decision. After the first year, I was promoted to Team Leader and Senior Software Engineer where I took charge of improving the software development process, helping developers for better collaborative work, and looking for methods that will improve issue and bug tracking systems. Since then, Software Engineering has become my passion;  Learning new skills on how to supervise and evaluate operations of software projects led me to research to implement software practices that will enhance the company performance and products.

I believe that any academic or scientific researcher must acquire some tutoring skills and experience. Thus, prior to my work in EngNet Company, I worked as Teaching Assistant in the October University for Modern Science and Art (MSA), Egypt. Additionally, I have been working as a Teaching and Research assistant in the American University in Cairo (AUC),Egypt , since Sep., 2008. My responsibilities include preparing tutorials and course materials as well as correcting assignment and projects. I have been assisting in presenting and advising for various courses ranging from Software Engineering and AI to Logic Design and Embedded Systems. Even though my main goal is to become a researcher, teaching is in itself an enriching experience which improved my skills in both professional and personal aspects.

%Our research in AUC focuses on Arabic Digit Recognition specifically analyzing and measuring the efficiency of different features and classification algorithms
 	Besides working as a teaching assistant in AUC, I also work as a research assistant in Arabic Handwriting Recognition group directed by Dr. Sherif Abdelazeem. During my work, we proposed a new domain specific features to improve recognition of Arabic Digit Recognition systems. Additionally, we collected a new Arabic on-line Digits Handwriting datasets were collected to be used as benchmarks. Lately, We are conducting a comparative study of Arabic Character and Word Recognition systems using different benchmark datasets.

Pattern Recognition is may main field of interest, more specifically in the areas of cursive handwriting recognition specially Arabic and Farsi languages. My interests emerge from the increase need for solutions to solve the Arabic-Farsi handwriting problem. I am also interested in document and old manuscripts analysis and processing but I am open to any idea in the field of Pattern Recognition.% Furthermore, I am interested in software engineering research; particularly ideas like software collaboration and maintenance research. My interest in this area is mainly because of my previous experience as a software engineer where I got passionate about providing tools for software engineers to improve and speed the development process.

  	In conclusion, pursuing a PhD degree will help me achieve my goal as a researcher. My choice of studying abroad is based not only on the research experience that I will gain in  studying in another university but also on the experiences I am sure I will gain by living in a diverse community. The Concordia University is ranked as one of the top universities in Canada which will provide me with the high caliber qualities that I need to widen my vision. I am proud that my professors and supervisors see me as a responsible, reliable and self motivated person. I am confident that my experience will enable me to contribute to the on-going research at the Concordia University.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my candidacy.
