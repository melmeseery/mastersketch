\section{Outline Or What to write}
You have to really dig. Be introspective. Don't settle for I love this field. Why do you love this field? Why do you want to work in this field for the rest of your life? Why does it complete you?
 
\subsection{General Notes}
\label{sec:General}
  \begin{enumerate}
	\item  If, for instance, you talk about your deep desire to make society a better place, your application should reflect it. Have you done anything about this desire? Can you talk about your actions and experiences\\
	  \hrulefill
	  
	  \hrulefill
	  
	  	  \hrulefill
	  	  
	  \hrulefill
\item How to make the essay unique 
 One of the best ways to do this is to discuss, briefly, an idea in your field that turns you on intellectually. It's an effective essay-opener, and it lets you write about something besides yourself for a bit. There are other benefits as well. The idea you choose to talk about, and your comments on it, often tell an admissions committee more about you than your own self-descriptions can.
Discussing an idea will catch people's attention and give your readers a reprieve from people writing about themselves. That me-me-me  stuff can get irritating after a while, even though it's what the prompt asks for. A discussion of an idea demonstrates your interest in your field, rather than just describing it. Ultimately, that's more convincing.\\

	  \hrulefill
	  
	  \hrulefill
\item do not use love reading,......What do you love about it? How does it affect you? What do you want others to know about how and why you read? Who do you most hope to reach through your reading and writing?\\

	  \hrulefill
	  
	  \hrulefill
	  
\item Personal stories can sometimes be effective, particularly stories of hardships overcome or of an emerging sense of purpose. 
\item  	What makes me different from other grad school applicants?
\item What is important to you? Why is it important? How did you develop these values? In particular, which  experiences and activities influenced your values and reflect them?
\item What is distinctive about you? What anecdotes reveal that distinctiveness?\\

	  \hrulefill

\section{Essay}
Artificial Intelligence and Image processing was two of the most interesting courses that I took in my last year in undergraduate school. 
I always thought of a computer as a super intelligent machine, understanding that simple trivial tasks for humans are considered the most challenging problems in computer science was inspiring. The knowledge was gained when I took Artificial Intelligence and Image processing in my last year in undergraduate school. Taking these courses affected my choice for graduation project, it made me think more of a research project that tends to AI and Machine Vision rather than other disciplines. My graduation project (Face Recognition) was chosen to help me pursuit more understanding on the problems of Machine Vision. 
//further increase my  in  improve my knowledge and  to I choose my graduation project  to solve one of the Machine vision problems. 


 Teaching and work in resala with the orphans helped me to tone my temper and given to improve my weakness as I wanted to present an ideal for the children that they can imetate. It helped me focus on how could I improve my self more to help myself and my comunity. 
 
 
 My research intereset are in field of software engineering in how to use old experiences, projects, bugs, programs to help improve the quality and speed of the software engineering process. using AI, data mining methods is one of the major ideas that are used to help use old requriments in the new software project.  It may not be a silver bullet that solve the software engineering problems but adding new thinking that may help practiceners.  \\
 My interset in helping user interact with the computer as humans, we should be able to sketch , write , speak to a computer and be understood. These are trivial things for humans but they are major chalanges in AI. Until now cursive handwriting like arabic and other langauge are still a chanllanging problem. Recognizing sketch is also another field that only recently had atracted researcher. The dificulty is mainly the amount of ambuigus of how different humans write using different style. 
 

 
 I love about reading is gaining more knowldge , I starve for more knowldge more understanding knowing that the more i read the more i new of new areas that i want to know about and i add the my reading list. I remmeber the first book i read about software engineering, \"twenty years : no silver bullet\" it was amazing book and it made me think more of software engneering it made me read more of the topic and get interseted in the current research and new techolgies that solve these problems.   It is entertainig to live with a book and know mroe about other, how they think and how they feel and what motivate others I feel like i am gainig their experience plus my own.   
 
 I force my self for improving my self and any one around me like when i was in the company and i research how to improve our current software process. I introduced to the company many software concept that helped in imporvoing the quality of the final product and the quality of the proces it self. I gained more experience in managing other and helping them adopt to new knowldge and how to ahere to concepts that will provide effective productive products.   I was persistant in requiring and adopting the changes from every one around me. The persistance that helped me to acomplish my goals in both the company final product and my imporivng my self. 
 
 I am proud that i am self motivated  , persistant and always move to improve and add knowldge to my self. My hobbies are reading new books about every thing novels, sceince, humman develpment and even new medical advances.  Trying new techology gadget, programs, protocol and devices. It comes from my facincation with how techology can change our life and how now we are adopted easily to new technology.  I also have a liesure time in swiming, and helping other give me a great satisfactions on how could i help improve not only my self but others around me and even my coumnity.  \\
