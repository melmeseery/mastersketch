% introuduction
% I dream of participating in building a world-class research in Egypt, my country. I am confident that both my experiences in the academic (as a Research Assistant) and industrial (as a Software Engineer) sectors provided me with the necessary background to pursue my dream. Applying for internship in Information Management and Web Technologies research group is step towards achieving my goal.
%
% In the years that following gaining my Bsc. engineering degree I worked on increasing my experience in both the academic and practical sectors. At the beginning, I worked for four years as a Software Engineer in EngNet Company, Egypt. I was responsible for designing and implementing various CAD tools that help communication engineers to solve design problems. After the first year, I was promoted to Team Leader and Senior Software Engineer where I got more involved in building various educational CAD tools. Even though I have gained a lot practical experience I wanted to pursue my dream as an academic researcher.
%
%  Therefore, since 2007, I have been affiliated with the 'Signal and Image Processing' research group in the Electronic Research Institute (ERI), Egypt. The position offered a research environment which I believe is essential for conducting any constructive research.  Additionally, I have been working as a Teaching and Research assistant in the American University in Cairo (AUC),Egypt, since Sep., 2008. My research focuses on investigating and evaluating the use of Swarm Intelligence in field of Image processing. I also worked on integrating this work with my Master's thesis in Sketch Recognition and Understanding.
%
%
% %I envision that Data Analysis and Visualization as one of the fields that joins
% both HCI and Artificial Intelligence fields. I believe that future of computer systems is developing programs that empower collaborative team work. Therefore, I envision Information visualizations and collaborative interactions fields as two of the most important research field nowadays. Also, current educational system requires more interracial systems between student and teachers. A new project to increase student interactions in learning environments is one of my major interests.
%
%
% 	%In conclusion, pursuing an internship will help me achieve my goal as a
% 	researcher.  I am sure that both my previous and currently growing research experiences provide me with the necessary to pursue this position. I know that research requires persistence, hard work, and self motivation and management skills. I am confident that my experience will enable me to contribute to the on-going research at London Knowledge Lab.


 %in the Information Management & Web Technologies research group at the Department of Computer Science & Information Systems, Birkbeck, University of London%Applying to a PhD program in your esteemed institute is a step towards achieving my goal. I have an immense interest in the research conducted in Software Engineering Research Group specifically in Software Engineering and HCI research areas. I believe that the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary is the most suitable place for me to pursue my PhD.

%`` Computers can be easily programmed to perform things that humans find difficult'', this statement was my assumption for a long time. In my senior year as an undergraduate in computer engineering major, I found out that trivial functions, such as speaking, listening, perception and understanding, are actually the most challenging problems for computers. Being convinced with the importance of having these tasks performed by computers, I built my interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision fields. %that combines both fields; AI and computer vision, in
 %
%My interest in research started early through my undergraduate study which impelled me to look for a research problem my graduation project. I choose my project to be ``Face recognition and Identification'' where I investigated various face recognition and skin detection methods. This project showed me what it meant to work in research and how to handle the frustration of wrong or unexplained result. On the other hand, the thrill and the continuous motivation to gain more information, ideas help investigating more creative problem solving techniques. In short, I knew then that I want to continue to work in the scientific research career.

%	Although my dream was to become a scientific researcher, I believed that I need more practical experience before the involvement in another academic research. Thus, I worked for four years as a Software Engineer in EngNet Company, Egypt. During my work I was engaged in various discussions and negotiations that taught me how to resolve conflicts between different opinions and compromise to reach a final decision. After the first year, I was promoted to Team Leader and Senior Software Engineer where I got more involved in software process and how to improve the performance of developers. Since then, Software Engineering has become my passion; I took charge of improving the software development process, helping developers for better collaborative work, and looking for methods that will improve issue and bug tracking systems. Learning new skills on how to supervise and evaluate operations of software projects led me to search on how to implement software practices that will enhance the company performance and products.


 %Both my experiences as a software engineer and my research oriented graduation project emphasized that my dream is working as researcher in an academic institute. Therefore, since 2007, I have been affiliated with the 'Signal and Image Processing' research group in the Electronic Research Institute (ERI), Egypt. The position offered a research environment which I believe is essential for conducting any constructive research. My work in ERI focused on investigating and evaluating the use of Swarm Intelligence in field of Image processing. I also worked on integrating this work with my Master's thesis in Sketch Recognition and Understanding. I worked on evaluating the efficiency of different Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms on segmenting users hand drawn sketch. Engaging in research discussions and projects opened my mind to other fields of research other than my own, which was very helpful to provide me with a breadth of information that will definitely help me as a researcher in the long term.


	%I believe that any academic or scientific researcher must acquire some tutoring skills and experience. Thus, prior to my work in EngNet Company, I worked as Teaching Assistant in the October University for Modern Science and Art (MSA), Egypt. Additionally, I have been working as a Teaching and Research assistant in the American University in Cairo (AUC),Egypt , since Sep., 2008. My responsibilities include preparing tutorials and course materials as well as correcting assignment and projects. I have been assisting in presenting and advising for various courses ranging from Software Engineering and AI to Logic Design and Embedded Systems. Even though my main goal is to become a researcher, teaching is in itself an enriching experience which improved my skills in both professional and personal aspects.


	%Besides working as a teaching assistant in AUC, I also work as a research assistant in Arabic Handwriting Recognition group directed by Dr. Sherif Abdelazeem . Our research in AUC focuses on Arabic Digit Recognition specifically analyzing and measuring the efficiency of different features and classification algorithms.  The research focuses on investigating and experimenting new domain specific features to improve the accuracy and speed of current Arabic and English Digit Recognition systems. We are currently extending the research to the recognition of Online Arabic handwriting.

	%Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is my main field of research interest. More specifically, I am interested in the use of machine learning algorithms in image processing and for improving Human Computer Interaction (HCI). My attention for HCI applications increased due to the importance of creating easier, faster and reliable HCI which led to introducing of new interfaces like Table-Tops and tangible interfaces. Furthermore, I am interested in the usage of artificial intelligence in software engineering; particularly ideas like transforming requirements using natural language processing or mining knowledge. I am also interested in using intelligent agents in software engineering and performance evaluation.  My interest in this area is mainly because of my previous experience as a software engineer where I got passionate about providing tools for software engineers to improve and speed the development process. I am also open to other research ideas related to software engineering.

 	%In conclusion, pursuing a PhD degree will help me achieve my goal as a researcher. My choice of studying abroad is based not only on the research experience that I will gain in  studying in another university but also on the experiences I am sure I will gain by living in a diverse community. The University of Calgary is ranked as one of the top universities in Canada which will provide me with the high caliber qualities that I need to widen my vision. I am sure that both my previous and currently growing teaching and research experiences provide me with the necessary background in Computer Engineering to pursue further studies. I know that research requires persistence, hard work, and self motivation and management skills. I am proud that my professors and supervisors see me as a responsible, reliable and self motivated person. I am confident that my experience will enable me to contribute to the on-going research at the University of Calgary.
